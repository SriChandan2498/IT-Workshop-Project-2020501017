        <ul> <li>The increasing urban traffic provokes
            the need to provide a solution for this by providing improved transportation
            technique.<br></li>
            <li>Sky bus is one of the better solutions for this which is a unique
            mass transit system which can be put up in any congested and crowded city
            for ease and safe transportation, without loss of time.</li> 
            <li>The purpose of this
            system is to carry the passengers from one point to other by occupying less
            ground space such that traffic jams over busy roads can be avoided. Hanging
            type of coach is designed that is supposed to be holding the sky track arranged
            over the poles.</li>
            <li>Destination point is identified through sensors by which
            the coach will be halted at the exact destination. Once the coach reaches to its
            destination, its door segment will be positioned exactly towards the platform
            by which the door will be opened automatically.
            <li>The demo module is constructed with Electro-mechanical
            components and is driven by the reduction gear mechanism type DC motors.</li>
           <li>Power source is Solar energy transmitted wireless through Resonance Coils.</li>
            <li>The control circuit is
            designed using the microcontroller along with the motor driving chip H –
            Bridge IC.

        <h2>Industrial Project: PROTECTION OF 600MW TURBOGENERATOR</h2>
        <p><strong>location:</strong> Kakatiya Thermal Power Project, Chelpur.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ABSTRACT: </strong> In a power plant, generator is the most important and costliest equipment. So
                it is essential to know about the components of a generator and auxiliary systems which help in its operation. The knowledge of the components helps in
                better understanding of the effect of any fault which occurs and the need for
                protection of generator against the fault.
                Sealing the generator shaft so that the gas inside the generator doesn’t come
                out, providing primary water for cooling purpose, providing gases for cooling and purging purposes, providing excitation for the generator are done by
                the auxiliary systems thereby helping in generator’s operation. Thus it is also
                important to know about the auxiliary systems.
                Every generator is connected to a power system. In order to protect it from
                faults and other disorders protection system contains elements which disconnect it from the system if necessary. Even though manual observation is
                present, the effective protection of the system is achieved by the automatic
                detection and prevention of faults for continuous generation safeguarding the
                apparatus. We make use of relays for this purpose.
                A relay is a circuit that senses the abnormal conditions and ensures the safety
                of the circuit equipment from damages and normal working of the healthy
                portion of the system. Relays have good characteristics like selectivity, sensitivity, speed, reliability, simplicity etc. which help in efficient protection of
                generator. Thus in this project report all of these are discussed in a detailed
                manner.

        <h2>Wireless HomeSecurity System Using Arduino-Uno</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Made with fundamental elements like Aurduino Uno, PIR sensor and RF transmitter and reciever coils</li>
            <li>includes Aurduino-Uno Programming which is similar to C-Language. </li>
            <li>This Arduino motion sensor can detect the presence of a person in a
                room which then creates an alarm sound using a buzzer to scare the intruder away.
                Therefore, we can build projects such as burglar alarms, automated appliances, etc.</li>
            <li>including GSM module for message alerts is in the future scope. </li>
